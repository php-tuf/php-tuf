/**
 * A payload is a builder for a server-side TUF metadata file.
 *
 * A payload represents a single role in the TUF repository. This could be one
 * of the four top-level roles (root, timestamp, snapshot, and targets), or it
 * could be a delegated targets role at any level of nesting.
 *
 * Every payload has relationships to other payloads. There are two kinds
 * of relationships:
 *
 * - A "parent" relationship is for a payload that enumerates other payloads.
 *   For example, a snapshot has a parent relationship to all targets roles,
 *   regardless of nesting level. The parent may need to be updated when one
 *   of its children change something. (For example, the snapshot payload needs
 *   to be updated if any of the targets roles add or remove a target.)
 * - A "key ring" relationship is for payloads which sign other payloads. There
 *   are really two possible key rings in a TUF tree -- the root payload signs
 *   the top-level roles (including itself), so it is the key ring for those
 *   payloads. A targets role can sign its delegates, so it is the key ring for
 *   any roles it delegates to. Key rings only need to be updated if their
 *   children add or revoke any keys.
