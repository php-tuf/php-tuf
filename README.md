# PHP-TUF

PHP-TUF is a PHP implementation of [The Update Framework 
(TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/) to provide signing and verification for 
secure PHP application updates. [Read the TUF 
specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md) 
for more information on how TUF is intended to work and the security it
provides.

PHP-TUF project development is primarily focused on supporting secure automated
updates for PHP CMSes, although it should also work for any PHP application or
Composer project. Contributing projects:

- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)
- [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/)
- [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/)

## PHP-TUF client requirements

The PHP-TUF client is designed to provide TUF verification to PHP applications
for target signatures.

- Minimum required PHP version: 7.2
- Requires `ext-json`
- The `paragonie/sodium_compat` dependency provides a polyfill for the Sodium
  cryptography library; however, installing `ext-sodium` is recommended for
  better performance and security.
  
## PHP-TUF server requirements

We recommend using the [default CLI 
implementation](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/CLI.md)
(a Python application) to generate keys and signatures as a part of your
project's release creation process. This will require:
- Python 3.8+
- PIP 19+

@todo More detailed instructions.

### Server environment setup for the Python TUF CLI

1. Install Python 3.8+ and PIP 19+ (not tested on earlier but may work).
1. Set up a virtual environment:

       python3 -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate

1. Install dependencies and TUF:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

## Code style

Run `composer phpcs` to check for code style compliance. The code adheres to
PSR-2 code standards.

## Testing

### Running the tests
1. Ensure you have all required dependencies by running `composer install`.
2. Run `composer test` at the project's root.

### Test fixtures setup

1. [Set up the TUF server environment locally](#server-environment-setup-for-python-tuf-cli).

1. Start a `fixtures` directory:

       mkdir fixtures

1. Initialize the repository and add/sign a target:

       repo.py --path=fixtures/ --init --consistent  # Defaults to Ed25519
       echo "Test File" > testtarget.txt
       repo.py --path=fixtures/ --add testtarget.txt

### Using test fixtures

1. From `fixtures/tufrepo`:

       python3 -m http.server 8001

1. From `fixtures/tufclient`:

       mkdir -p tuftargets
       curl http://localhost:8001/targets/testtarget.txt > tuftargets/testtarget.txt
       client.py --repo http://localhost:8001 testtarget.txt
       # A 404 is expected for N.root.json unless a key has been rotated.

## Dependency policies and information


To provide a lightweight, reliable, and secure client, external dependencies
are carefully limited. Any proposed dependency additions (and those
dependencies' dependencies) should undergo the [Drupal core dependency
evaluation process](https://www.drupal.org/core/dependencies#criteria).

For evaluations and policies of current dependencies, see the [PHP-TUF
dependency information](DEPENDENCIES.md).
